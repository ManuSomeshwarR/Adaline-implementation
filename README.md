# Adaline-implementation
This repository contains an implementation of the Adaline (Adaptive Linear Neuron) algorithm, a type of artificial neural network used for binary classification tasks. Adaline is a single-layer feedforward network that adjusts its weights to minimize the error between the predicted output and the desired output.
It  is a single-layer feedforward neural network used for binary classification tasks. It is closely related to the perceptron algorithm, but with some key differences.

Architecture: Adaline consists of a single layer of neurons, where each neuron computes a weighted sum of its inputs and passes it through an activation function to produce an output. Unlike the perceptron, Adaline uses a linear activation function.

Activation Function: Adaline uses a linear activation function, which means the output is a linear combination of the inputs and weights.

Weight Update: The key idea behind Adaline is to minimize the difference between the predicted output and the desired output by adjusting the weights of the network. The learning rule used by Adaline is the Widrow-Hoff rule or the delta rule.
The weight update rule is based on gradient descent and aims to minimize the mean squared error between the predicted output and the target output.

Training: During training, Adaline iteratively adjusts the weights and bias term to minimize the mean squared error. The training process involves the following steps:
Initialize the weights and bias to small random values or zeros.
Compute the predicted output by multiplying the input features with the weights and adding the bias term.
Calculate the error as the difference between the predicted output and the target output.
Update the weights and bias using the weight update rule.
Repeat these steps for a fixed number of epochs or until convergence.

Prediction: Once Adaline is trained, it can be used to make predictions on new input data. Given a set of input features, Adaline computes the weighted sum of the inputs and applies the linear activation function to produce the output. The output can be thresholded to obtain binary predictions if needed.
